                  "Back in May, when summer was just getting started, I sold my house.  It happened so fast that I hardly had time to pack it up and move before the new owners wanted to make it their new home.

            <h3>Gardening</h3>
            <p>Let me tell you about <em> WHY</em> I did so much gardening this summer. Well my sister lives in the middle of downtown Union and her house is surrounded by the elementary school.  Two churches and the City Hall are also her neighbors. She lives a main entersection too.  So lots of people drive, walk, and bike by.  But she did not have any flowers or plants.  </p>
