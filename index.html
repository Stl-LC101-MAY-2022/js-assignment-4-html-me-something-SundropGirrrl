               <h2>Moved from the City to the Country</h2>
               <p id="testp">
                  "Back in May, when summer was just getting started, I sold my house. It happened so fast that I hardly
                  had time to pack it up and move before the new owners wanted to make it their new home. So I tried
                  selling or giving away as much stuff as I could before I moved in with my<em>... OLDER SISTER,
                     Susan!</em> So I moved from where I live the last 15 years, South City St. Louis, to the Franklin
                  County country town of Union, MO. I was going from city to country living. That has been a shock
                  because it is no longer a quick drive to IKEA, ALdis, Target, Home Depot, etc. AI have to drive to
                  another town now for those things or maybe even 20 miles awawy. And I no longer had all the
                  neighborhood apps to help me sell or get rid of things quickly. And I had to figure out where all my
                  house stuff would go because she had her own house stuff. The biggest moving truck I could rent and 5
                  movers hauled all my stuff to the country. Lots of people were interested in what was going on when
                  they saw all the furniture come out of the truck and go into my siser's house. And we still had to
                  decide what to donate, store in her shed or keep. We had several sets of things like 3 refrigerators,
                  4 washers and dryers, 6 TVS, 4 couches, 6 beds, and 5 vaccuums. There are just 2 of us now living in
                  this 2 bedroom house. Where were we going to put what we decided to keep? Well each week we donated a
                  couple of car loads of items to a church organization. We made "Free!" signs an just sat items out in
                  the front yard. Soon we got rid of or duplicate items. Next we had over 70 boxes. It took over 2
                  months to unpack and give my sister's house a <em>HOME MAKEOVER!</em>

         <h3>Gardening</h3>
         <p>Let me tell you about <em> WHY</em> I did so much gardening this summer. Well my sister lives in the middle
            of downtown Union, MO and her house is surrounded by the elementary school. Two churches and the City Hall
            are also her neighbors. She lives a main entersection too. So lots of people drive, walk, and bike by. But
            she did not have any curb appeal. That means the outside of the house looked like it was super old- which it
            is over 100 years old. It needed some flower beds and plants that would come back each year. Those are
            called <em> perennials </em>. I did created gardening projects for all 4 sides of her house. I dug out old
            stones that got buried over time and now we have a walkway to a nice patio. I dug up 30 bricks and created
            decorative flower beds with them just like my mom had made 20 years ago. I dug a moats around sidewalks for
            rubber mulch to go in and added new solar nights. But the biggest gardening feat was digging holes, hauling
            off not very good clay mud, replacing it with potting soil mix, so we could have flower and plant beds that
            would feed the plants and keep them healthy. I had to make over 10 trips to Lowes and Walmart just to get
            the soil and mulch. And each time I would buy more plants and flowers. I bought over 75 plants!!! It took me
            at least a month to get all the gardening projects completed. We have 9 hanging plants. One the squirrels
            now use as a swing. I would work on it sometimes from noon to 9:30 pm. I would be sore and super muddy. But
            it felt good to be accomplishing something. I still have to pant the porches but the gardening added that
            curb appeal. The biggest bummer from all my summer work was that I have gotten massive Poison Ivy outbreak 3
            times. Bad enough to need to go to the doctor for shots and medicine. And the medicine makes me feel very
            HOT!!!

         <h5>Concerts</h5>
         <p></p>
         Speaking of hot, I also spent a lot of my nights at summer music concerts. By know you know that I like to play
         to music. I like all kinds of music and have been going to concerts since I was a teenager. This summer I saw a
         legend from when I was your age. He was already so popular that I saw an impersonator, who dressed like and
         sounded like him, when I was 13. That impersonator was called "Almost Willie" because he looked like legendary
         singer, Willie Nelson. So I got to see the REAL Wille this summer. His guitar was so well loved it had holed in
         it! I also saw many older bands that your grandparents probably went to concerts of when they were younger.
         Bands like REO Speedwagon, Blues Traveler, and Backstreet Boys. And more current musicians like Flo Rider,
         Miranda Lambert, Brandi Carlile, Walker Hayes, Tim McGraw, etc. I saw so many I cannot remember them all. And I
         still have passes to see many more concerts all the way into October.

         <h4>Codinging</h4>
         <p>I started learning how to write computer code. This means I know a little bit about how how the internet
            works. I have been learning a new language called JavaScript. That is a computer languge but I feel like
            could be French because it is so new to me. And I dont know what many of the words are or mean. It is alot
            like learning to JavaScript but it is written in French. I do not speak or read French. AAGH! But I learn a
            little each week. I have class two nights a week, lots of homework and assignments. Even test! Hopefully
            when I get more comfortable and better at it, I can apply the skills. The goal is to know how to use the
            coding language to create websites, apps, and maybe work for companies like Google, Seesaw, Mystery Science,
            or even YouTube.

         <h6>Relaxed</h6>
         <p> I have had a SUPER busy summer and it went by like a blink of the eye. First I moved houses, then I tried
            to spruce my sister's house. </p>
